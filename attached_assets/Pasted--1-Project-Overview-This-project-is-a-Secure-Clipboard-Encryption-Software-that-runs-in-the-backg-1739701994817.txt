📌 1. Project Overview
This project is a Secure Clipboard Encryption Software that runs in the background, automatically encrypting and decrypting copied text. It works seamlessly with WhatsApp and other messaging platforms, ensuring that:

✔ Outgoing messages are automatically encrypted when copied and replaced in the clipboard.
✔ Incoming messages are automatically decrypted when copied from WhatsApp and displayed as plaintext.

This adds an extra layer of security on top of WhatsApp’s encryption, ensuring that even if someone accesses your messages, they remain unreadable without the decryption key.

📌 2. Core Features
🔹 Encryption & Decryption
✅ Automatic Encryption – When you copy any text, it gets encrypted and placed back into the clipboard.
✅ Automatic Decryption – When you copy an encrypted message, it gets decrypted and displayed instantly.
✅ Secure Key Storage – Encryption keys are stored securely using OS-protected key management.

🔹 WhatsApp Integration
✅ Works with WhatsApp Web/Desktop – Encrypts and decrypts copied messages.
✅ Protects Sent Messages – Ensures that even if someone accesses your clipboard, they see only encrypted text.
✅ Decryption on Copy – No need to manually decrypt—just copy an encrypted message, and it’s instantly readable.

🔹 Security Features
✅ AES-256 Encryption – Uses military-grade encryption for maximum security.
✅ Auto-Clear Clipboard – Clipboard data is erased after 30 seconds to prevent unauthorized access.
✅ Password/Hotkey Decryption – Users can decrypt messages with a shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+D).
✅ Stealth Mode – Runs in the background with minimal system impact.

📌 3. Theoretical Concepts
1️⃣ Clipboard Monitoring
Uses event-driven monitoring to detect when text is copied.
Automatically triggers encryption or decryption based on the copied text.
2️⃣ Text Encryption & Security
Uses AES-256 encryption for protecting copied text.
Keys are stored in a secure keyring/password manager to prevent leaks.
3️⃣ Clipboard Modification
After encryption, the clipboard is updated with the encrypted text.
When decrypting, the clipboard is updated with the plaintext version.
4️⃣ Authentication for Decryption
Hotkey-based decryption for fast access.
Optional password authentication for high-security users.
📌 4. Workflow & Algorithm
🔹 Encryption Process (Sending Messages)
1️⃣ User copies a message.
2️⃣ Software detects the copied text in the clipboard.
3️⃣ The text is encrypted using AES-256.
4️⃣ The clipboard is updated with the encrypted version.
5️⃣ The user pastes the encrypted message in WhatsApp.

🔹 Decryption Process (Receiving Messages)
1️⃣ User copies an encrypted message.
2️⃣ The software detects encryption and automatically decrypts it.
3️⃣ The decrypted text is shown instantly or copied back to the clipboard.

📌 5. Implementation Plan

2️⃣ Development Stages
🔹 Stage 1: Clipboard Monitoring
✅ Implement a background script to detect clipboard changes.
✅ Use event-driven detection for efficient performance.

🔹 Stage 2: Encryption & Decryption
✅ Use AES-256 encryption for copied text.
✅ Store encryption keys securely using keyring.

🔹 Stage 3: Clipboard Update System
✅ Replace the clipboard with encrypted text after copy.
✅ Restore plaintext on decryption automatically.

🔹 Stage 4: Authentication System
✅ Implement hotkey-based decryption (Ctrl+Shift+D).
✅ Add optional password-based authentication.

🔹 Stage 5: Auto-Clear Clipboard
✅ Automatically clear clipboard after 30 seconds.
✅ Prevent unauthorized access to copied sensitive data.

🔹 Stage 6: WhatsApp Integration
✅ Detect WhatsApp-specific text copying events.
✅ Show decrypted text in notification or UI window.

🔹 Stage 7: Packaging & Deployment
✅ Convert to an executable file for easy installation.
✅ Optimize for low CPU and memory usage.

📌 6. Expected Outcome
✔ All copied text is encrypted instantly.
✔ Only authorized users can decrypt messages.
✔ WhatsApp messages remain private even if accessed by others.
✔ Clipboard automatically clears for extra security.
✔ The software runs efficiently in the background.

📌 7. Future Enhancements
🔹 Mobile App Support – Sync messages with Android/iOS securely.
🔹 Multi-User Support – Share encrypted messages with trusted contacts.
🔹 Custom Encryption Options – Support RSA, ChaCha20, etc.
🔹 QR Code Decryption – Scan QR codes to decrypt on mobile.

📌 8. Conclusion
🚀 This project provides an additional layer of encryption for copied text, ensuring that even if someone accesses your clipboard, they cannot read your messages.
